        <p>
            I currently am a Bartender in Reno, NV. There are many aspects to my job that I believe will help me to succeed as a full stack developer. The first and most important is interpersonal skills. Often I am starting and steering conversations with new guests throughout the night which has taught me to communicate with a multitude of different people. The second skill I have gained is the ability to prioritize and perform under intense pressure. The summer can be chaotic behind the bar, and I have to focus on both getting drinks out to my customers as well as getting drinks to the servers. Prioritization is essential to success.
        </p>

            Outside of work I enjoy a number of activities including rock climbing, fly fishing, and a bit of woodworking. One thing these hobbies have in common is that they all have some barriers to entry. It generally comes down to acquiring the gear and knowledge I need, the patience required to solve problems, or finding access for areas in fishing and climbing specifically. These will not only help me while applying to jobs, but while I am working in the field as well. I look forward to applying my life experiences and knowledge as a developer.
